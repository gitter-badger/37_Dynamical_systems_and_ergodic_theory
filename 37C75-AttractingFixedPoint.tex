\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a vector field on a manifold $M$ and let $F_t$ be the flow of $X$. A fixed point $x^*$ of $X$ is called {\em attracting} if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x^*$ such that for every $x\in U$, $F_{t}(x)\to x^*$ as $t\to\infty$.

The stability of a fixed point can also be classified as stable, unstable, neutrally stable, and Liapunov stable.
