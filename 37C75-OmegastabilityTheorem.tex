Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and let $f\colon M\to M$ be a $\mathcal{C}^k$ diffeomorphism. We say that $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^k$-$\Omega$-stable, if there is a neighborhood $\mathcal{U}$ of $f$ in the $\mathcal{C}^k$ topology of $\operatorname{Diff}^k(M)$ such that for any $g\in \mathcal{U}$, $f|_{\Omega(f)}$ is topologically conjugate to $g|_{\Omega(g)}$.

$\Omega$-\textbf{stability theorem}. If $f$ is Axiom A and satisfies the no-cycles condition, then $f$ is $\mathcal{C}^1$-$\Omega$-stable.

\emph{Remark.} The reciprocal of this theorem is also true (the difficult part is showing that $\Omega$-stability implies Axiom A), but it is unknown whether $\mathcal{C}^k$-$\Omega$-stability implies Axiom A when $k>1$. This is known as the $\mathcal{C}^k$ \emph{$\Omega$-stability conjecture}.
