Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. We say that a diffeomorphism $f\colon M\to M$ satisfies
(Smale's) \emph{Axiom A} (or that $f$ is an Axiom A diffeomorphism) if
\begin{enumerate}
\item the nonwandering set $\Omega(f)$ has a hyperbolic structure;
\item the set of periodic points of $f$ is dense in $\Omega(f)$: $\overline{\Per(f)} = \Omega(f)$.
\end{enumerate}
Sometimes, Axiom A diffeomorphisms are called hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, because the portion of $M$ where the ``interesting'' dynamics occur (namely, $\Omega(f)$) has a hyperbolic behaviour.
