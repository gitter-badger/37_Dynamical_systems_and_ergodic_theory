\begin{document}
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A fixed point $x$ of a diffeomorphism 
$f\colon M\to M$ is said to be a \textbf{hyperbolic fixed point} if $Df(x)$ is a linear hyperbolic isomorphism. If $x$ is a periodic point of least period $n$, it is called a \textbf{hyperbolic periodic point} if it is a hyperbolic fixed point of $f^n$ (the $n$-th iterate of $f$).

If the dimension of the stable manifold of a fixed point is zero, the point is called a \textbf{source}; if the dimension of its unstable manifold is zero, it is called a \textbf{sink}; and if both the stable and unstable manifold have nonzero dimension, it is called a \textbf{saddle}.
