\begin{document}
Let $f$ be a measure-preserving transformation of a probability space $(X,\mathscr{A},\mu)$. We say that $f$ is \emph{mixing} (or strong-mixing) if for all $A,B\in\mathscr{A}$, 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(f^{-n}(A)\cap B) = \mu(A)\mu(B),$$
and $f$ is \emph{weakly mixing} if 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|\mu(f^{-i}(A)\cap B)-\mu(A)\mu(B)| = 0$$
for all $A,B\in\mathscr{A}$.

Every mixing transformation is weakly mixing, and every weakly mixing transformation is ergodic.
