\begin{document}
Let $f$ be an homeomorphism mapping a topological space $X$ to itself or a flow on $X$. An heteroclinic point, or heteroclinic intersection, is a point that belongs to the intersection of the stable set of $x$ with the unstable set of $y$, where $x$ and $y$ are two different fixed or periodic points of $f$, i.e. a point that belongs to $W^s(f,x)\cap W^u(f,y)$.
