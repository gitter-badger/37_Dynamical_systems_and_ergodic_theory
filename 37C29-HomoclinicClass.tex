\begin{document}
Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold and $f\colon M\to M$ a diffeomorphism. The \emph{homoclinic class} of a hyperbolic periodic point $p$ of $f$, denoted $H(p,f)$, is the closure of the set of transverse intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds all points in the orbit of $p$; i.e.
$$H(p,f)=\operatorname{cl}\left(\bigcup_{n\in \N} W^s(p)\pitchfork \bigcup_{n\in \Z} W^u(p)\right).$$
Homoclinic classes are topologically transitive, and the number of homoclinic classes is at most countable. Moreover, generically (in the $\mathcal{C}^1$ topology of $\operatorname{Diff}(M)$), they are pairwise disjoint and maximally transitive.
