\begin{document}
Let $M$ be a compact differentiable manifold and let $f\colon M\to M$ be an Axiom A diffeomorphism. The nonwandering set $\Omega$ of $f$ can be partitioned into a finite number of compact topologically transitive blocks, called basic blocks:
$$\Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^m \Lambda_i.$$
Moreover, each basic block is partitioned into a finite number of compact subblocks $\Lambda_{ij}$, $j=1,\dots, m_i$ such that $f(\Lambda_{ij})=\Lambda_{i(j+1)}$ for $1\leq j<m_i$ and $f(\Lambda_{im_i})=\Lambda_{i1}$, and $\Lambda_{ij}$ is topologically mixing for $f^{m_i}$.
